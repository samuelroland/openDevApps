# openDevApps - Manual
Up-to-date for v0. - Version 0.0 
This a the manual... Coming when the extension will be available as `v1.0`.
**Work in Progress**.

When you just installed the extension for the first time, you got a interface like this:

As you can see, there is no link and no category (`All` is not a category, it just the view with all existing links).

As suggested, open the `Settings` by clicking on the settings icon:

  Okay, but before managing links and categories, how are these elements organised together ?

There is an independant list of links that you will create. They don't depend on the categories. Each link contains a link string, a name and if it's local or not. These 3 information are entered at the link creation.

### Create a link
Let's create a first link pointing on `github.com`. On the bottom text input, as suggested by the placeholder (`New link + Enter`), let's enter the link and hit enter.

Then as suggested by the placeholder (`Set name + Enter`), let's enter the a name and hit Enter.

Then check or uncheck the checkbox. The checkbox answers to the question `Is the app hosted/running in local ?`. You can presse `Space` key to check or uncheck (or use the mouse obviously) then hit Enter. Then the link appear (you see the name and on hover you can see the link as popup).
