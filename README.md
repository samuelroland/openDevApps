# openDevD
![icon](icon.png)  
My first web extension, that is able to visit the local dev or prod instance of [DevDashboard](https://github.com/samuelroland/DevDashboard).

## Features
1. Open a URL to a local html file (defined at installation) to open DevDashboard page. (URL ex: `file:///C:\users\me\.....\DevDashboard\index.html`)
1. Open an url to a local server. (URL ex: `localhost:8056`)
1. Open the url with the local server only if the server is up, and else open the html file. If HTML file is not found, don't open and display error message.
1. Display other favorites links in a short list (little panel opened extension click).
1. Automatic alert when a new version is available/released on GitHub and on AMO (AMO = addons.mozilla.org).

## Models
Coming soon...

## Goals
This is a very little project, only **to take in hand web extensions building**.
- **Discover and learn WebExtension programming**, by practice ad by reading the Mozilla documentations
- **Understand how extensions are built** (structure of files, possibilities and API availables, ...)
- Build a very little tool that **will be useful for me** (and that can be useful for other local apps, just by changing URL).
- **Publish the app on AMO**. (To learn first. Maybe it will be useful for other devs. No big ambition :)).
- **Train for future web extensions projects**... (Too much idea in my head).
